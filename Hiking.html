                A huge part of the identity of the Hawaiian Islands is surfing. With world-class waves that attract
                surfers from around the world, there is a multitude of beaches where surfers love to congregate. Oahu is
                the third largest of all the Hawaiian Islands. Known as ‘The Gathering Place,' it offers an assortment
                of surfing opportunities that appeal to both beginner and experienced surfers.
                <br>
                Oʻahu is considered by many as the surfing mecca of the world. From the heavy-duty breaks located on the
                North Shore—which has even been given the flashy nickname of the “Seven Mile Miracle”—to the pristine
                fun-sized surf on Oʻahu's southern shoreline, there's plenty of surf to go around.
